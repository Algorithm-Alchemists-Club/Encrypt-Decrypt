# Encrypt-Decrypt

## Overview

Welcome to the **Encrypt-Decrypt** project! This repository contains a Java-based encryption and decryption tool developed by the Algorithm Alchemists Club. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective method for encrypting text and subsequently decrypting it using a custom algorithm.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Convert plain text into an encrypted format using our custom algorithm.
- **Text Decryption**: Revert encrypted text back to its original plain text format.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.
